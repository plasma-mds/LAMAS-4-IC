# LAMAS 4 IC
This repository contains the schema and example files for the laboratory approved metadata acquisition schema for ion chromatography (LAMAS 4 IC).

## Aim

LAMAS 4 IC was developed to support the findability and reusability of research data in analytical measurements utilizing the ion exchange chromatography. So far, it is implemented for anion and cation exchange chromatography measurements. This repository is intended to provide a starting point for the collaborative advancement of the metadata schema by the scientific community.
